Once a new version completes, it shall be added as a new folder in Version History Folder, without having it's own Version History Folder.
The index of the version that is inside this folder needs to be altered, so that clicking on the Site's History button should always lead to the VersionHistory.html in this folder.
the idea is to create a functioning loop, instead of a rabit hole.
